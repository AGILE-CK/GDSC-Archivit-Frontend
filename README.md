#### About our solution 
In our current korea society, various incidents of violence have emerged as a serious social issue. The Archivit app aims to help vulnerable individuals live a healthy life without worrying about tomorrow amid these incidents.

We provide users with an AI-powered recording feature to adopt evidence of violence when they are exposed to such situations. Even in situations where victims cannot manually record, AI recognizes the violent situation and automatically proceeds with recording, which can be immensely helpful for victims in legal proceedings.

We offer information on how victims of verbal and physical violence can receive assistance and overcome their situations. Through various platforms where victims can seek redress, we make it easy to find information that may have been difficult to obtain through internet searches.

Furthermore, we provide a template feature that allows victims to record their daily experiences. Through this feature, victims can document events in writing, enabling them to adopt more accurate evidence and alleviate stress by expressing concerns they may not have been able to share with anyone before.

Finally, when used as evidence, we have added a feature that utilizes AI to convert voice recordings into text, making past situations easier to report and understand. Through these measures, we believe that victims of violence can resolve problematic situations without injustice.
